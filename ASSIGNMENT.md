# AI Creative Studio Full-Stack Developer Intern - Technical Test

**Project Deadline:** Up to 3 Days

## Project Overview

Build a web-based AI Creative Studio that integrates Google Gemini APIs for both text generation and image generation. This project tests your ability to work with modern web technologies, AI API integration, authentication, and responsive UI design.

You may choose to build an AI Creative Studio for any **ONE** of the below business use cases:

- **Real Estate** – Virtual Staging app - Refer MLS Virtual Staging guidelines in the US (to be able to add furniture to an existing room)
- **Fashion** – Virtual Clothing app (to generate consistent clothing options worn on any user in image form)
- **Restaurants** – Menu visualizer (to create appetizing food imagery for menu items that haven't been photographed yet)
- **Marketing Agency** – Product Ad Marketing app for Beauty products / Cosmetic industry (to generate image ads)

---

## Required Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (recommended) or React.js
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes (recommended) or separate Node.js backend
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (Email/Password)
- **AI APIs:** Google Gemini (from Google AI Studio)
- **Image Generation:** Google Nano Banana image gen model (from Google AI Studio)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

---

## Core Features (Required)

### 1. Authentication System

1. User registration with email and password
2. User login with email and password
3. Protected routes (users must be logged in to access the app)
4. Logout functionality
5. Display user email in the UI

### 2. Text-to-Image Generation

**Core Workflow:**

1. User enters a text prompt in an input field
2. User clicks 'Enhance Prompt' button (optional)
3. LLM (Gemini) optimizes the prompt based on best practices
4. Enhanced prompt replaces the original in the input field
5. User clicks 'Generate Image' button
6. Display loading state while image is being generated
7. Show generated image with download option

#### Prompt Enhancement System

**Hint:** Use Google's Nano Banana prompt guidelines when asking Gemini to enhance the prompt. Tell Gemini to make the prompt more detailed, specific, and visually descriptive.

You can use **Vercel AI SDK** to communicate with LLM and image gen models.

When the user clicks 'Enhance Prompt', your LLM should improve the prompt by:

- Adding specific details about style, mood, and composition
- Including technical photography/art terms if relevant
- Specifying lighting, colors, and atmosphere
- Making the description more vivid and detailed

### 3. Generations Page (Advanced)

**Basic Implementation:**

- Show generated image on the same page as the prompt input
- Allow user to download the image

**Advanced Implementation (Bonus Points):**

- Create a separate `/generations/image-id` page
- Display all images generated by the logged-in user
- Store generation data in Supabase database:
  - User ID (from Supabase Auth)
  - Original prompt
  - Enhanced prompt (if used)
  - Image URL (store in Supabase Storage)
  - Timestamp
- Show images in a responsive grid layout
- Allow users to view, download, or delete their generations

---

## Bonus Features (Extra Credit)

Implement at least **ONE** of the following bonus features to earn extra points:

### ⭐ Image Gallery

- Persistent storage of all generated images
- Use Supabase Storage for image hosting
- Display images in a responsive grid
- Show metadata (prompt, date, etc.) on hover or click

### ⭐ Batch Generation

- Allow users to generate multiple variations (max 4) from one prompt
- Display all variations in a grid layout
- Add subtle variations to the enhanced prompt for each generation
- Show loading progress for each image

### ⭐ Style Presets

- Pre-defined artistic styles (e.g., 'Photorealistic', 'Oil Painting', 'Anime', 'Watercolor')
- Interior design templates (e.g., 'Modern Minimalist', 'Rustic Farmhouse', 'Industrial Loft')
- Allow users to select a style before generation
- Automatically append style-specific keywords to the prompt

**Example:**
- User selects 'Oil Painting' style
- Append: `, oil painting style, brushstrokes, textured canvas`

---

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Requirements

- **Framework:** Next.js 15+ (App Router preferred) or React 19+
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (recommended)
- **Responsive Design:** Must work on mobile and desktop (1024px+)
- **Loading States:** Show spinners/skeletons during API calls
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages

**UI Library Recommendation:** Consider using **shadcn/ui** or such pre-built components that look professional out of the box. (optional)

### Backend Requirements

- **API Routes:** Use Next.js API routes or separate Express.js backend
- **Environment Variables:** Secure storage of API keys
- **Error Handling:** Proper try-catch blocks and error responses
- **Rate Limiting:** Consider implementing basic rate limiting (optional)

---

## API Setup Guide

### Google Gemini API (Free Tier)

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click 'Get API Key' in the left sidebar
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the API key and save it securely

**Models to Use:**

- **Text Generation (LLM):** Gemini LLM
- **Image Generation:** Google Nano Banana image gen model

**Free Tier Limits:**

Google Gemini offers generous free tier limits (15 RPM for Flash, 2 RPM for Pro). This should be more than sufficient for your test project.
